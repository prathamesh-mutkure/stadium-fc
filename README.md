# Stadium FC - Internship

This repo contains the React.js project created by me for round 2 of Stadium FC internship application.

**Website:** [https://stadiumfc-internship.herokuapp.com/](https://stadiumfc-internship.herokuapp.com/)

Player can be searched based on following attributes:

- Name
- Club
- Country/Nationality
- Age

I've converted the CSV data to `.json` format and assigned `id` to each player for convenience.

_NOTE: The website may load slower at first as it's hosted on heroku's free tier which shuts off the dyno when not active for an hour_

#### Test Locally

Run locally with command - `npm start` and it will automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
